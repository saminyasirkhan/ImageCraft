Developed an image processing application in Python using Tkinter, CustomTkinter, and PIL, with a focus on user interaction, security, and reliability.

Designed a responsive graphical interface with features including greyscale conversion, inversion, brightness adjustment, and contrast enhancement.

Implemented secure PIN entry to restrict unauthorised access, alongside magic number validation to prevent unsupported or unsafe file uploads.

Refactored the codebase to eliminate redundancy, improving efficiency and maintainability.

Conducted thorough testing to verify image uploads, form validation, access control, and processing functionality under different usage scenarios.

Key areas covered
• Secure GUI development using Python
• Image manipulation and processing techniques
• Access control and file validation
• Code refactoring and software maintainability
• Functional and user interface testing
